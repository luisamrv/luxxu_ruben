          <div class="accordion-content"> 
            <p>
            Large chandeliers must be maintained by experienced professionals who know how to take them apart, to clean each part and
            to place everything back correctly.<br>
            The most important thing to remember when you are cleaning your chandelier is to treat it gently! Crystals can be scratched
            and damaged easily if you not handled properly and the chandelier frame can be ruined if you aren’t careful.<br>
            Remember to clean off fingerprints after hanging the texture or changing bulbs.
            </p>        
          </div>
          <h2 class="accordion-header">CLEANING FREQUENCY</h2>  
          <div class="accordion-content"> 
            <p>
            Small and medium sized chandeliers should be dusted regularly in order to avoid more integral cleaning procedures.<br>
            The cleaning frequency will depend where the lighting texture is. Entryway and near kitchen chandeliers tens to need more
            frequent cleaning.<br>
            A rule of thumb is to clear the lighting every 12 months.
            </p>        
          </div>
          <h2 class="accordion-header">METAL FIXTURES</h2>  
          <div class="accordion-content"> 
            <p>
            Metal textures are protected with a coat of clear UV varnish to keep the finish from tarnishing, so brass polish is not necessary.<br>
            Damage to this protection coating from harsh cleaning products may lead to a tarnished finish. Do not use damp cloths,
            abrasive cleaners or water on the metal as these may damage the surface.
            Dust regularly with a soft dry cloth.
            </p>        
          </div>
          <h2 class="accordion-header">CRYSTAL FIXTURES</h2>  
          <div class="accordion-content"> 
            <p>
            Wipe the crystal surface and all the accent pieces with a clean, soft cloth on a regular basis to maintain the brilliancy of the
            crystals. Always use soft, cotton cloths. Paper towels and disposable dusting cloths can scratch the crystals.<br><br>
            <b>DRY CLEANING</b><br>
            Dry cleaning is the way of cleaning your lighting texture from dust using a clean and soft cloth.<br><br>
            <b>WET CLEANING</b><br>
            You need to prepare a place to set the crystals and light bulbs before you remove them.<br>
            If the structure of the texture allows for the crystal suspensions to be taken off, that will simplify the cleaning – just carefully
            wash them in cool water with special cleaning agents for crystals, then dry it with a soft cloth. Or put on a pair of cotton gloves
            soaked in methylated spirits and rub the crystal and ornaments gently. The spirits will evaporate very quickly, so soak your
            gloves into the spirits often while cleaning. Be careful not to clean around the metal textures.<br>
            If it is impossible to take off the crystal suspensions, then carefully and without pressure, wipe the crystals with wet and soft
            cloth.<br>
            Careful care and compliance with these easy LUXXU recommendations will help you enjoy the beauty of lamps, crystal chandeliers,
            wall lamps for long years.

          <div class="accordion-content"> 
            <p>
            Marble is a porous material. It is a soft stone susceptible to etching and staining if don’t protect it carefully.<br>
            Avoid acid solutions coming into contact with marble, applies to cleaning products as well (vinegar, lemon juice or other cleaners
            containing acid).<br>
            Wiping the surfaces with warm, sudsy water and a nonabrasive sponge or soft cloth is the best method for cleaning, but will
            not remove etching or stains that have had time to permeate the surface.
